# ambira-mobile
Ambira is a social media application on which users can track and share their productivity with others. You can follow your friends and your inspirations, and build an online community that is there to motivate and encourage accountability. Users can select from a wide array of productivity activities, from reading to studying to cooking, and monitor how long they spend with each activity. After completing an activity, users can add a caption, attach photos, and post their activity! However, the userâ€™s involvement in the communal aspect of Ambira is completely customizable with privacy flairs for each post. Users can choose to share their activities with everyone, just their followers, or keep them private for only them to see. Ambira redefines social media by inspiring focus, accountability, and motivation, helping users celebrate progress, not just presence.
